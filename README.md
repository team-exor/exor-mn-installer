# Exor MN Installer

### v2.0.0

A custom masternode install script made from scratch specifically for installing Exor masternodes.

Currently, it supports installation on Ubuntu 16.04+ and Debian 8.x+ x64 and should be generic enough to work on any VPS provider or as a local installation at home.

Since this script has the potential to install "extra" software components such as a firewall and/or create a swap disk file, root privileges are required to install properly. Therefore, you must either run the script using the `sudo` command prefix or else run directly as the root user (generally not recommended for security reasons but still supported).

All wallets are installed to the /usr/local/bin directory.

To save time on 2+ installs, the wallet binaries are archived in the wallet directory (typically /usr/local/bin/Exor) after the first successful install and those locally stored files are then used to install subsequent wallet installs in much less time than the first.

## Install Instructions

To begin, you must first download the initial script and give it execute permission with the following command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/team-exor/exor-mn-installer/master/exor-mn-installer.sh && chmod +x exor-mn-installer.sh
```

#### Install 1st/default wallet using IPv6:

```
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh
```

#### Install 1st/default wallet using the default IPv4 address:

```
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -N 4
```

#### Install 2nd wallet using IPv6:

```
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -n 2
```

#### Install 2nd wallet using IPv4:

**NOTE:** You cannot install more than one IPv4 wallet on the same IPv4 address. Assuming you have purchased more than one IPv4 IP address, you will need to explicitly specify the 2nd IP address using the `-i <ip address>` argument

Example:

```
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -n 2 -N 4 -i 45.32.168.34
```

**NOTE:** Installing the 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc wallets are identical to the 2nd wallet except that you would change the `-n` value to 3, 4, 5, etc

```
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -n 3
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -n 4
sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -n 5
```

**NOTE:** If you are installing multiple wallets, they do not need to be installed in any specific order although it is generally easier to install in numerical sequence (install 1 then 2 then 3, etc).

## Update Instructions

#### Update Single Wallet Install

At any point after the initial installation you can "refresh" a particular wallet install by re-running the following command:

`sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh`

This will "remember" all of your previously installed settings and allow you to update the installed wallet to the latest version (assuming a new version has been released since the last update/install).

If you would like to keep your wallet installed but just change one of the options, such as ip address type, you could update install using something like this:

`sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -N 4`

This would allow you to change an IPv6 installed wallet into an IPv4 wallet. **NOTE:** Changing options like this will most likely require you to reconfigure your controller wallet exor.conf and masternode.conf files. The 'Final setup instructions' are always displayed at the end of an update install the same way as they are for the initial install.

#### Update All Wallet Installs

To update all installed wallets with a single command, use the following:

`sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -U`

## Command-Line Options

- -h or --help

     Displays the help menu

     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -h`
- -t or --type

     Install type. There are 2 valid options: i = install (default), u = uninstall
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -t i`
- -w or --wallet

     Wallet type. There are 2 valid options: d = download (default), b = build from source
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -w b`
- -g or --genkey

     The masternode genkey value. Generate this with the `masternode genkey` command either automatically from the VPS wallet (recommended) or from your hot wallet in the Debug Console). If left blank the value will be autogenerated
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -g 88pgtdc9rgiEFMarhuVAdDjeDBUiPbFPhqdafFsBUKcgS3XovPc`
- -N or --net

     IP address type. There are 2 valid options: 6 = IPv6 (default), 4 = IPv4
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -N 4`
- -i or --ip

     Specify the IPv4 or IPv6 IP address to bind to the node. If left blank and -N = 4 then the main WAN IPv4 address will be used. If left blank and -N = 6 then a new IPv6 address will be registered

     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -i 46.5.102.49`
- -p or --port

     Specify the port # that the wallet should listen on. If left blank the value will be auto-selected
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -p 4559`
- -n or --number

     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -n 2`
- -a or --adapter

     ```
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -u`
- -r or --reindex

     Purge the blockchain data files for the current wallet install. Use this option to get back on the main blockchain when a wallet becomes corrupt or forked. Only applicable to update installs. 3 valid options: r = reinstall from scratch, c = copy blockchain from another wallet, s = install from latest snapshot
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -r c`
- -R or --rpcall

     Send an RPC command to all wallets controlled by this script and display the results
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -R getblockcount`
- -S or --stopall

     Shutdown all wallets controlled by this script and wait for all to finish shutting down before continuing
     
     Usage Example: `sudo sh exor-mn-installer.sh -S`

```

#### Sample cron job to shut down all running wallets and reboot once a month:

1st allow reboot cmd to be run without root permissions:

```
sudo chmod u+s /sbin/reboot
```

Then add the following to a crontab:

```
0 0 1 * * sh exor-mn-installer.sh -S && reboot
```

Alternate syntax in case you need to provide the full path to the reboot cmd:

```
0 0 1 * * sh exor-mn-installer.sh -S && /sbin/reboot
```
